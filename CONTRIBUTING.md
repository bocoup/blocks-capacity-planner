# Contribution guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Capacity Planner block! The
goal of this guide is to help you get your bearings on the project.

## Branching strategy

If you're contributing code, you should work from a different branch depending
on the kind of change you are making:

- bug fixes - use the `master` branch
- new features - use the `dev` branch

Following this convention helps use respond to high-priority issues quickly,
and it makes it easier to schedule more substantial releases.

## Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's code of conduct,
available in the file named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
